In this project report, the measurement of voltage, resistance, capacitance, temperature, and humidity (VRC TH) using Arduino has been described technically.  By utilizing various sensors and components, we can accurately measure and monitor these parameters, enabling us to gather valuable data for a wide range of applications.
The objective of this project is to design a system that can measure and monitor voltage, resistance, capacitance, temperature, and humidity using Arduino. By implementing this system, we aim to create a measurement system that is capable of measuring the abovementioned parameters with a fair degree of accuracy and to display the results on an OLED screen for effortless observation.
